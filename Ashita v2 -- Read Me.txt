..:: Ashita v2 Alpha Testing ::..

    Hello and welcome to the Ashita v2 Alpha Testing!
    Please keep in mind this is an alpha stage of Ashita v2, expect to crash!
    
    At this time the ADK (Ashita Development Kit) is not released with the package.
    I am still finalizing things and do not want people to assume things will remain
    how they are currently. But in the next few Alpha updates I will reinclude it.

..:: Ashita Font Objects ::..

    Moveable Font Objects
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Font objects are now moveable with the mouse. In order to move a font object,
        you must do the following:
            Hold Shift + Click and hold the font object.
    
        Font objects are able to lock their position so not all objects will be moveable!
